APPOINTMENTS BOOKING:

- When a client books an appointment, it updates its status in a database to booked = True 
and the client name in the appointments table. 
- The logged in lawyer should receive a real-time notification (explained below) that an appointment 
has been booked (through websokets). While receiving the notification, a number appears in the navbar
counting all the unchecked appointments. This number is obtained as the javascript sends an http request
to fetch the amount of all the unchecked appointments.
- Once the lawyer clicks on the notification bell, the appointments become checked, and a modal appears
that shows all the appointments sorted by data (through an http request)
- The appointment becomes checked every time the lawyer clicks the modal, checks his profile appointments 
section(which has refresh button) or checks the appointments page.

APPOINTMENTS REAL-TIME NOTIFICATION MECHANISM:

- A user(lawyer only) connects by sending a websocket request to the consumer via the Websocket objects. 
- The script that connects the user(for lawyer only) exists on navbar. it runs only if the user is authenticated. 
- When the user clicks the button for the appointment booking, an http post 
  request will be sent to the BookAppointment view (sending a json of its username and lawyers name).
- Once the view saves successfuly the appointment as booked, it will send a 
  websocket request(through websockets library) to the AppointMentBookingConsumer.
- The AppointMentBookingConsumer inherits from AsyncWebsocketConsumer for increasing performance.
- When a page of the app loads, it will send a websocket request to the consumer (through the javascript 
  Websocket object which script will be in the navbar component for the notifications).
- The consumer, in its overwritten connect method, will close the connection of any unauthenticated user 
  and accept the authenticated once.
- If the user is authenticated, it will evaluate if the user is a lawyer or not. If it is, the channel of 
  the user will be added in a room that has the name of his username.
- In the overwritten receive method of the consumer, the text data will be broadcasted to the room that has 
  the same name with the lawyer's name sent in the payload.

We will use 2 background workers:
- For deleting appointments that ended 2 days ago or more.
- For reminding appointments that will happen in 3 hours to the client and a lawyer.

For the above functionalities i use Python multiprocessing. The reasons why:
- I want to achieve true parallelism, to avoid any reduction in the app's responsiveness.
- In the daemon process, for separations of concerns and to reduce complexity, the daemon
  will contain no logic. All the implementation of the needed actions will be handled by 2 
  django views, and the daemon will just make those request internally in the time needed.
- The above mentioned urls will have api strong keys save in .env file, in order to not be 
  accessible by anyone except the daemon.
